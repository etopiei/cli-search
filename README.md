# CLI Search
This project is a little script I wrote to be able to quickly and easily search different sites from the command line.

## Examples

Searching google for the latest bitcoin price:

	$ search google latest bitcoin price

Or searching github for this repository:

	$ search github cli-search etopiei

## Installing

To install this simply clone it:

	$ git clone git@github.com:/etopiei/cli-search.git

Then run:

	$ make install

## Updating

If you have already installed this program but want to update it then either re-download it or pull the new changes. Then update from the command line like so:

	$ make update

## Contributing

To contribute just submit a pull request or open an issue if you find any bugs. 
If you have any further questions email me at: me.etopiei@gmail.com
